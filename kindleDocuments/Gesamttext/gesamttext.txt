 The issue with the battery door opening is thus solved, but Amazon went further, eliminating the door altogether and wrapping the back with sleek stainless steel .

 Before purchasing, I was obsessed with the reviews and predictions I found online and reading about some of the critiques such as the thick border, the lack of touchscreen, lack of battery SD slot, lack of a back light, awkward difficult keyboard layout, minimally faster page flipping, and the super, high price .

 As for the battery, Amazon's explanation was that it'd thicken the Kindle, so I'm fine with it b c the slenderness of the K2 is such a plus .

Short battery life ,  I charged this thing for a couple of hours, 24 hours ago ,  it's still running and just at 75% of full power .

 which, I guess, is unavoidable with rechargable batteries, but I wish I could change the battery myself .

 The battery was almost fully charged upon receipt so I turned it on and I was in business .

 Good thing the nook boasts a removable back cover, because the store clerk had to take it off to remove the battery for a hard restart .

It took very little time to get used to having to push a button to turn pages and the screen flash as they turn only really startled me the first few times .

 I don't feel the need to push the button ahead of time to prepare for the end of the page at all, which evidently a lot of Kindle 1 owners do since it's a bit more sluggish .

 In fact, the entire navigation structure has been completely revised ,  I'm still getting used to it but it's a huge step forward .
topic: navigation
Navigation is a huge improvement .
topic: navigation
 Clearly, Amazon was hard at work to make navigation quicker and easier .
topic: navigation
 I tried out the free 14 day trial on newspaper downloads, what a great way to get your news,  no advertising distractions, easy to navigate and automatically downloaded every day .
topic: navigation
 Once I got used to it, the navigation was easy too .
topic: navigation
 The Sony store is cumbersome to navigate, and slow .

Despite the lighter text, I prefer the K2 for its thinness and its improved navigation and I use if far more than my K1 .
topic: navigation
 On the Kindle, you have wireless delivery, easy navigation, no ads, no need to flip to page D17 and find the place where you left off .
topic: navigation
The main issue I had with Kindle 1 was the navigation button design and placement .
topic: navigation
 It is easy to navigate without any risk of accidentally changing the page I'm on .
topic: navigation
 The home page is easier to navigate .
topic: navigation
 It lets you quickly navigate periodicals ,  moving to the next article with just a click right or left, or up to the section or article list with a flick up or down .
topic: navigation
 Losing the side cursor gives Kindle 2 a cleaner look ,  but it's the greatly improved navigation that's the real benefit .
topic: navigation
 This ease of navigation is one of the most compelling new features of Kindle 2 for me .
topic: navigation
 The problem with Kindle and I expect E, readers is that while Amazon is asking the book publishers to adhere to a standard of navigation to support these features, Amazon does not have the manpower to review each book submitted to see if its been published to their specification .
topic: navigation
 Amazon claim's it's only 20% faster, but it FEELS almost twice as fast ,  and the menus are much better organized and easier to navigate .

0 out of 5 stars Significant improvements to ergonomics and navigation, February 24, 2009
topic: navigation
There are several on, screen navigation improvements due to faster e, ink :
topic: navigation
The Kindle 1 roller button and quirky silver navigation bar are gone .
topic: navigation
There is a new 5, way navigation toggle for left, right, up, down plus  press  .
topic: navigation
I'm generally enjoying these navigation changes .
topic: navigation
 It is significantly easier to hold and to navigate relative to the Kindle 1 .
topic: navigation
 This is a beautiful little product  it feels sleek and sturdy and   booklike in my hands, the controls are finally where they ought to be and the navigation interface is intuitive and easy to learn .
topic: navigation
 As advertised, it is very easy on the eyes, combined with font sizing and easy navigation this does what it was meant to do .
topic: navigation
Some PDFs' tables of contents DID work as a navigable set of links .
topic: navigation
For typing and navigating, the e, ink technology takes patience and a little getting used to , ,  especially for frenetic folks in task mode .
topic: navigation
 1 the ink takes a moment to display on the screen after your input from the keyboard or navigation contoller  2 the keyboard input is stiff and requires a direct punch on the very tiny keys to register  3 the keyboard is so close to the bottom of the unit, and the Kindle is so flexible, typing is something of a laborious or even tortured action for relatively short notes such as this paragraph actually written on the Kindle 2 .
topic: navigation
Navigation is much easier with the 5, way button .
topic: navigation
 There can be occassional minor  ghosting  problems where the screen does not completely update on a page turn or when navigating .
topic: navigation
 I realize the K1 did not have this either, but it sure would be easier to touch the places you want to navigate than use the joystick .
topic: navigation
 Instead, it displays the book title and there is no way to navigate to the last page read .
topic: navigation
 The fastest way to navigate through a larger work   would be to leave your page, go to the table of contents and choose the most likely chapter and then proceed page by page from there till you reach your desired page .
topic: navigation
 As mentioned above, the free copies also do not have active table of contents, so navigation is well near impossible beyond simply ploughing through form start to finish, which is what I did .
topic: navigation
 Again navigation is by using the next and previous page buttons .
topic: navigation
I think in most areas the Kindle 2 has met expectations, but a sluggish cursor, poor navigation and almost non, existent capability to organize content are major drawbacks .
topic: navigation
 The largest difference was the touch screen at the bottom, but once you're doing the primary thing that e, readers do   it becomes a non, issue, as it's only for navigation .
topic: navigation
 It's actually slightly more awkward to navigate using the touch screen because you have to look between both screens, whereas with the Kindle you just use the directional rocker in the planned direction .
topic: navigation
The Kindle is really fun to use and I'm having a blast learning to navigate it and how to use all its features .
topic: navigation
 I find navigating the device page turns, menus, etc .
topic: navigation
I also found using the navigation button difficult .
topic: navigation
 I have some more to learn about searching and navigating, but if an old geezer like me can do it, anybody can .
topic: navigation
>> Far better navigation between articles in periodicals, and easier navigation overall with its five, way controller replacing the K1's clumsy and time, consuming navigation wheel and cursor
topic: navigation
 The new navigation button works well, and the keyboard   feels good to my fingers .
topic: navigation
The thumb stick navigation on the Kindle takes some getting used to, especially those who use touch screens or mice everyday .
topic: navigation
3 Easy page turns and navigation .
topic: navigation
 Navigating the menu is almost intuitive and becomes easier and easier as you go .
topic: navigation
 The buttons work well even with my large fingers and the navigating 5, position control is easily mastered and easy to use effectively .
topic: navigation
 I find it easier to have it in hand than navigating through the on, screen version .
topic: navigation
 The pages are easy to flip, the menu is easy to navigate, and it is easy to forget that you are not reading a  real  book !
topic: navigation
 The screen reads like paper, it is easy to navigate .
topic: navigation
 I find myself reading faster, because the text is more readable for me, and the navigation through the book is so very easy .
topic: navigation
 I couldn't imagine trying to navigate internet pages without it .
topic: navigation
 I really enjoy the menu button and the 5, way controller to navigate .
topic: navigation
I found the screen readability and overall user experience of navigating the device to be excellent .
topic: navigation
I found the Kindle Store to be full featured and easy to navigate, and was impressed that you even have the ability to write book reviews directly from the device .
topic: navigation
 The buttons on the K2 are not easily pressed while reading, and I love the 5, way button that allows me to easily navigate between my newpaper pages   .
topic: navigation
I was worried about navigation without the scroll wheel, but find it much easier to use and it is more productive and faster to use the new navigation .
topic: price
 If a case was included, as with the Kindle 1, that would have been reflected in a higher price .
topic: price
 lower overall price, with nice leather cover .
topic: price
If you have the first Kindle and are deciding whether to upgrade, do it now while you can still get a good price for your old Kindle on Amazon's Marketplace, craigslist, wherever .
topic: price
 Before purchasing, I was obsessed with the reviews and predictions I found online and reading about some of the critiques such as the thick border, the lack of touchscreen, lack of battery SD slot, lack of a back light, awkward difficult keyboard layout, minimally faster page flipping, and the super, high price .
topic: price
 However, I think all the positives of the K2 greatly make it worth the price which I'll talk about below .
topic: price
 We have all paid for our covers whether it's an  extra  cost or added in to the price of the e, reader .
topic: price
 Amazon is not charging full price to replace a broken or damaged Kindle .
topic: price
 I believe that what he said was that when the books were on the NYT Best Seller's list, they would be priced at $9 .
topic: price
 When the book was no longer on that list, the price could change .
topic: price
 There are text books and other books that run in the hundreds of dollars price range .
topic: price
of course they won't be priced at $9 .
topic: price
 The difference between the books I've purchased and the price of the Kindle is about $166 .
topic: price
 In addition, the prices for books are often more expensive , ,  particularly new releases .
topic: price
One last thing I was unaware of is how much free or nominally, priced content there is for the Kindle .
topic: price
 Konrath are offering novels at prices ranging from $1 to $2 dollars, as a way to find new readers .
topic: price
00, so the price of Kindle effectively dropped to $349 .
topic: price
 Savings trump purchase price with Kindle's low book price advantages .
topic: price
I would have been glad to have paid any price to have had a book reader that was easier to read for myself with 20 20 vision and especially for the low, vision reader .
topic: price
I did see a few big price differences eg .
topic: price
The other drawback for some is the price .
topic: price
 Book prices are less than you will find in book stores and may be less than you will find on other e, book sites .
topic: price
Is the K2 so much better than the K1 as to justify the price ?
topic: price
 the BUT comes in and applies to the fact that the price for the downloads has been going up and up .
topic: price
 since the cost of the kindle is high anyway, the benefit, other than easy storage, was the reduced price of book downloads .
topic: price
The lack of such an obvious and necessary feature, especially considering the price of the device, really degrades its value and usability .
topic: price
 I want you to know that ultimately, however, if I want a Kindle I will have to capitulate and accept Amazon's terms because Amazon has a monopoly over their own machine, and I will have to purchase one even at prices I believe are needlessly high for e, book readers .
topic: price
 And I know for sure that many print publishers will see this as an opportunity to provide attractively priced paper books as an alternative .
topic: price
 At the steep price of this device we should get better quality components .
topic: price
 To have this continuous, high speed, wireless connectivity without the need for a physical computer to upload download onto is truly amazing and makes the price of the Kindle truly irrelevant .
topic: price
 price  , and intuitive operation your parents and grandparents can operate this device, if you are fortunate enough to still have them !
topic: price
As a teacher, I really wanted this machine and have been waiting for the price to drop so that I could give myself the excuse to purchase it .
topic: price
 Disappointing given the prices .
topic: price
 The price for new hardbacks on the Kindle is great too .
topic: price
 After reading the reviews and pondering the price all day, I took the plunge .
topic: price
 The ability to plug in headphones and play Miles Davis to drown out the screaming kid while you are reading at the doctors office is priceless .
topic: price
If you are searching for a REAL review on the Kindle 2 by someone that was waiting to receive it rather than complaining about price or other issues then here it is .
topic: price
 However, I will say, the selection of inexpensive books has been worth the purchase price of this item  especially for those that enjoy reading the classics or nationwide news, it has been a joy to purchase entire collections for a fraction of the cost of purchasing new or even used books .
topic: price
 Those in college, with children or just have a love of reading will likely find the convenience and savings well worth the price .
topic: price
 I found many simply by doing a search on genre's of interest with price  low to high  as a default .
topic: price
 To justify the purchase price, those functions really need to be there .
topic: price
 The price of these 'classic' titles is pretty hard to beat, too .
topic: price
I was a little miffed when i saw that they would now be charging for the Kindle cover, which was included in the price for the previous version .
topic: price
 Mind you, it's the same size as the Kindle 1, and that of most book pages, but I for one dream of something larger without a larger price tag .
topic: price
 If I have to spend the full puirchase price on the K2 with a K1 still in hand I would have probably waited .
topic: price
Although pricey, the real value of this purchase is that it got me to read again .
topic: price
But, as far as my reading experience with the kindle 2, I have downloaded so many books and all at a fraction of the original price .
topic: price
 I just hope that the price goes down .
topic: price
 Yes, it costs extra, but they lowered the price on the Kindle 2 so that buying the basic cover costs plus the purchase price of the device itself equals the cost of a Kindle 1 .
topic: price
 But given my book storage issues and how much it would cost me to rent a bigger apartment here in the City, I didn't mind paying the current price .
topic: price
 That may not be true for everyone, but, as I said, I'm sure the price will eventually come down .
topic: price
 Some people may find this an inconvenience, but I think it is just a small price to pay for delayed convenience especially where I am located .
topic: price
 Books are retardedly pricey .
topic: price
 Should have been priced at $250  .
topic: price
 Even if you want to , I think it is way too pricey .
topic: price
 The subscription prices and book prices are really good from what my wife tells me .
topic: price
 Though it would be nice if the cover was included in the K2 price, it is still worth buying .
topic: price
 It is pricey but if you buy as many books as I do, it will pay for itself within a year due to the low cost of most books .
topic: price
